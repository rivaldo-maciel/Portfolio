      <p>
        My name is Rivaldo. I'm 24 years old. I'm Full Stack Web Developer. I
        currently live in the city of Cruz√≠lia-MG. I am fascinated by everything
        that involves technology. Since I got my first computer in 2009, to this
        day it has become my favorite hobby, whether for gaming, image editing
        or developing personal/study projects. In addition to coding, I like to
        listen to music, watch films and series and I
        don't dispense a good conversation with my friends!
