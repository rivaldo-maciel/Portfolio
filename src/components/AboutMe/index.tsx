      <p>
        My name is Rivaldo. I'm 24 years old. I currently live in the city of
        Cruz√≠lia-MG. I'm Full Stack Web Developer. I am fascinated by everything
        that involves technology. Since I got my first computer in 2009, to this
        day it has become my favorite hobby, whether for gaming, image editing
        or developing personal/study projects. In addition to coding, I like to
        listen to music musical_note, watch films and series movie_camera and I
        don't dispense a good conversation with my friends speaking_head!
