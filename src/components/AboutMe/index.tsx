      <p>
        My name is Rivaldo. I'm 24 years old. I'm Full Stack Web Developer. I
        currently live in the city of Cruz√≠lia-MG. I am fascinated by everything
        that involves technology. Since I got my first computer in 2009, to this
        day it has become my favorite hobby, whether for gaming, image editing
        or developing personal/study projects. I build complete web applications
        (Front End, Back End and Database) with responsive design and end-to-end
        testing. My goal is to enter the job market as a Web Developer and be
        able to contribute with all the knowledge I acquired during my training.
